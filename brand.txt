# Saltwyk Brand Definition

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 5, 2026  
**Current Stage:** Stage 1 (Penetration, Months 0-12)

## Brand Promise

Saltwyk is the payment network that helps merchants prosper.

Unlike credit cards that tax merchants for market access, Saltwyk is a customer acquisition engine that increases margins while reducing payment costs. We make earned value liquid across a network, creating prosperity for both merchants and shoppers without debt.

---

## Category Definition

**Primary Category:** Payment Networks  
**Category We're Creating:** Rewards Commerce Infrastructure

We compete in the mental space of Visa, Mastercard, Stripe (payment rails). We create a new category: networks where earned value flows instead of debt.

---

## Five Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Anti-Extraction Ethos
Saltwyk exists to help merchants prosper, not to tax them. Never position Saltwyk as extractive infrastructure.

### 2. Anti-Debt Principle
Shoppers should spend what they've earned, not what they'll owe. Never enable or promote debt-based transactions.

### 3. Network-First Economics
Value comes from connections, not from controlling the asset. Never pursue strategies that trade network health for short-term revenue.

### 4. Earned Value Liquidity
Points should flow like money - instantly, universally, with no forced conversion. Never compromise transaction speed or success rate.

### 5. Merchant Empowerment
Merchants should control their economics, not be at the mercy of banks or platforms. Never remove merchant control or transparency.

---

## Current Stage: Stage 1 (Penetration)

**Timeframe:** Months 0-12  
**Primary Message:** "Accept points as payment, reduce credit card fees"

**ALLOWED CLAIMS:**
- Credit card fee reduction
- Transaction success rates
- Integration simplicity (<15 minutes)
- Zero capital required
- Instant settlement

**FORBIDDEN CLAIMS:**
- ❌ Margin improvement (no merchant data yet)
- ❌ Discount elimination claims
- ❌ Revenue growth claims

**Why:** Can't claim margin improvement without merchant data. Credit card fee reduction is immediate and provable. This builds trust before making bigger claims.

## Terminology Rules

### ✅ ALWAYS USE:

| Term | Definition | When to Use |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **earned value** | Points/miles/rewards shoppers have accumulated | Investors, press |
| **rewards commerce** | Transactions powered by loyalty points instead of credit | All audiences |
| **payment network** | Infrastructure enabling value flow | Investors |
| **customer acquisition engine** | Saltwyk drives discovery, not just payment | Merchants, investors |
| **points** | User-facing term for earned value | Shoppers, UI |
| **spend** | Shopper action with points | NOT "redeem" or "convert" |
| **accept** | Merchant action with points | NOT "enable redemption" |

### ❌ NEVER USE:

|----------------|-----|-------------|
| **redeem** | Implies coupons, not value | "spend", "pay with" |
| **convert** | Implies exchange, not direct payment | "spend", "use" |
| **loyalty platform** | Wrong category (we're infrastructure) | "payment network" |
| **points marketplace** | Implies buying/selling points | "payment network" |
| **alternative currency** | Regulatory red flag | "earned value", "points" |
| **crypto** / **web3** | Wrong technology association | Avoid entirely |
